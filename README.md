# <h1>My Cubing Abilities
Currently my abilities are not very developed as before this class I had probably only toutched a cube about **10** times.
Despite this I have signifigantly improved my ability with a pyraminx duo, yes it is considered easy but in my mind considering my   experience I believe my accomplishments are at least noticable.
  This improvement can be seen with my average times with them being ao5, 12 and 25 (they are listed in this repective order in seconds)
  <ol>
    <li>5.23</li>
    <li>5.18</li>
    <li>4.88</li>
  </ol>
Considering my first times with the pyraminx duo were around 30-45 seconds this is a very large improvement, and I have even been able to  understand algorythms that help me solve the cube, for example in my mind I like to solve one side by looking for a corner peice that has its colour attached to it and see where it needs to go, I move it out of the way of any peices that need to be moved so the center peice can be in the correct area once I solve the right side, then it should only take one crank on the back peice to fully solve.

<br>^ This procedure usually takes me about 3-5 turns to do depending on what is already set up, but it is hard to not explain with visuals, but if I do it incorrectly I do something else to at least solve the pyraminx which can easily be explained with steps v 

<br>
<ol>
  <li>Solve everyside so just the centre peices are mismatched</li>
  <find a side where its corresponding centre peice is on a side next to it and rotate the pyraminx duo so the centre peice side is under the edge peice side and the edge peice side is facing you</li>
  <li>begin by turning the right corner of the edge side peice up, then its left corner up in that order</li>
  <li>Then turn its right corner towards you, then its left towards you</li>
  <li>It should be solved</li>
  </ol>
 ^I have learned to memorize and use this algorithm after time in the classroom

<br>Finally on this cube, algorythims are what made it possible for me to solve a pyraminx duo blind a few times as they allowed for me to absorb more of what I was looking at when analysing the pyraminx duo before trying to solve it.

### <h2>Current Goals
  - [x] Find a way to explain my pyraminx duo methods
  - [x] Learn to solve a pyraminx
  - [x] Improve my pyraminx duo times
  - [x] Improve pyraminx abilities

##### <h3>Pyraminx
  I have been able to solve a pyraminx multiple times and can get to the end fairly reliably, however I am still unable to do so in a very timely manner, yet I still see it as fair to say that I have improved my abilities with the cube, from bringing my abilities of solving it almost with luck, to actually being able to know what to do to get what in a more formatted fasion. Despite all this I dont feel capable of describing how I solve because I have not had a moment to fully analyse my process, to get to the final stages but I can still describe these at the least in this ordered list
  <ol>
    <li>Check to see if you have one side solved and the outermost peices on each side are the same mismatched colours (ex: blue side has 2 red peices in the positions</li>
    <li>Then begin with having the solved side on the bottom and any one side facing you</li>
    <li>See which way the mismatched peices have to go, if they have to go right continue reading, if not, skip to step 7</li>
    <li>Begin by turning the right corner towards you, then the top peice to the right in that order</li>
    <li>Next turn the right peice away from you and the top to the right in that order</li>
    <li>Continue until the pyraminx is solved or in a postition that is close to being solved then at most you just have to turn the top once to put it in place</li>
    <li>If the peices have to go left the algorithm is similar to if they have to go to the right, start by turning the right corner towards you and the top peice left in that order</li>
    <li>Next turn the right peice away and the top peice to the left</li>
    <li>Continue until the pyraminx is solved or in a postition that is close to being solved then at most you just have to turn the top once to put it in place</li>
  </ol>
