# <h1>My Cubing Abilities
Currently my abilities are not very developed as before this class I had probably only toutched a cube about **10** times.
Despite this I have signifigantly improved my ability with a pyraminx duo, yes it is considered easy but in my mind considering my   experience I believe my accomplishments are at least noticable.
  This improvement can be seen with my average times with them being ao5, 12 and 25 (they are listed in this repective order in seconds)
  <ol>
    <li>5.23</li>
    <li>5.18</li>
    <li>4.88</li>
  </ol>
Considering my first times with the pyraminx duo were around 30-45 seconds this is a very large improvement, and I have even been able to  understand algorythms that help me solve the cube, for example in my mind I like to solve one side by looking for a corner peice that has its colour attached to it and see where it needs to go, I move it out of the way of any peices that need to be moved so the center peice can be in the correct area once I solve the right side, then it should only take one crank on the back peice to fully solve.

<br>^ This procedure usually takes me about 3-5 turns to do depending on what is already set up but if I do it incorrectly I do    something else to at least solve the pyraminx v 

<br>I solve everyside without the centerpeices being in the correct place, then I look for a side where the center peice is on the **side below it** then I turn corner _one_ away corner _two_ away, corner _one_ towards corner _two_ towards and it should be solved. I have been able to use this method thanks to Mr.O in the classroom.

<br>Finally on this cube, algorythims are what made it possible for me to solve a pyraminx duo blind a few times as they allowed for me to absorb more of what I was looking at when analysing the pyraminx duo before trying to solve it.
